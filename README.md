# Finance-and-Risk-analyst
In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Every individual or business actively searches for opportunities to get the maximum returns. However, in most of the cases, they either lack the skills to identify the right investment opportunity, or there is a shortage of time for finding these opportunities. Hence, this gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission - Portfolio managers.

 

A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realise the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments along with the right allocation. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best solution to the investor.

 

Consider yourself working for an associate at an investment firm that manages accounts for private clients. Your role requires you to analyse a portfolio of stocks to provide consultation on investment management based on client’s requirement. Let us hear more about it from Joydeep as he introduces you to the entire case
Following points summarise the expected tasks in the assignment:

You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise whether the security meets the criteria of your investor’s financial goals.
You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio.
After the selection of stocks, the portfolio must be validated using the active investment strategy to estimate the prices in future. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals set by the investor.
The next segment will help you with each task in detail. 
You are provided with the following information for 24 stocks of leading companies listed in New York Stock Exchange(NYSE):

Pharmaceuticals/Healthcare/Life Sciences
To help you with the market benchmark, you are given the S&P 500 index prices for the same period.
 

Now, you have a good understanding of the data and the problem statement. The next segment will help you with the details of the expected tasks.
Preliminary Steps
Under preliminary steps, you are expected to load the entire data into the working environment (Python). The entire data must be merged into a single dataframe with only the required columns. Most importantly, you must ensure that you can identify the company and the industry from the collated data for company-specific and industry analysis.

 

Data Exploration
As part of exploration, you must create interactive visualisation dashboards and evaluate the performance metrics that help in summarising the stock. Here, you can use any of the visualisation tools like Tableau, Plotly, Python, etc., however, the final outcome should reflect all the points mentioned in the video. Moreover, the findings should be backed by your understanding of the concept or the facts from the industry.


Stock Analysis and Portfolio Management
As part of this task, you must execute your responsibilities as the portfolio manager. You must use the information about the investor to create a profile, and use it along with the obtained results to create a portfolio of stocks that have the potential to meet the financial goals of both the investors.

 

Hint: As part of the active investment strategy, try to replicate the daily gains/returns from the past 5 years over the future to predict the value of the selected stocks.

 

Data Storytelling and Business Impact (Report + Video presentation)
Post the analysis, you must summarise all the findings, insights, visuals and recommendations in the form of an executive report to your investor.
